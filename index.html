<p>mTCP is a high-performance user-level TCP stack for multicore systems. Scaling the performance of short TCP connections is fundamentally challenging due to inefficiencies in the kernel. mTCP addresses these inefficiencies from the ground up - from packet I/O and TCP connection management all the way to the application interface.</p>

<p>Besides adopting well-known techniques, our mTCP stack (1) translates expensive system calls to shared memory access between two threads within the same CPU core, (2) allows efficient flow-level event aggregation, and (3) performs batch processing of RX/TX packets for high I/O efficiency. mTCP on an 8-core machine improves the performance of small message transactions by a factor 25 (compared with the latest Linux TCP stack (kernel version 3.10.12)) and 3 (compared with with the best-performing research system). It also improves the performance of various popular applications by 33% (SSLShader) to 320% (lighttpd) compared with those on the Linux stack.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-user-level-tcp" class="anchor" href="#why-user-level-tcp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why user-level TCP?</h3>

<p>Many high-performance network applications spend a significant portion of CPU cycles for TCP processing in the kernel. (e.g., ~80% inside kernel for lighttpd) Even worse, these CPU cycles are not utilized effectively; according to our measurements, Linux spends more than 4x the cycles than mTCP in handling the same number of TCP transactions.</p>

<p>Then, can we design a user-level TCP stack that incorporates all existing optimizations into a single system? Can we bring the performance of existing packet I/O libraries to the TCP stack? To answer these questions, we build a TCP stack in the user level. User-level TCP is attractive for many reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Easily depart from the kernel's complexity</li>
<li>Directly benefit from the optimizations in the high performance packet I/O libraries</li>
<li>Naturally aggregate flow-level events by packet-level I/O batching</li>
<li>Easily preserve the existing application programming interface</li>
</ul>
